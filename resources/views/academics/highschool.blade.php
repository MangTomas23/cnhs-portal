<h3>Calabanga National High School History</h3>

<p>Established several decades ago, Calabanga National High School is now occupying it’s new, spacious, and elevated two-hectare school campus located at Sta. Cruz, Calabanga, Camarines sur, about 1-5 kilometers away from the Poblacion or 20mins drive from Naga city via the national high-way.<p>





<p>Municipal resolution No. 60, series of 1996 sponsored by the councilor David M. Hernandez during the administration of Mayor Dominador V. Medroso, established the Calabanga High school in July 1966. It was housed in Calabanga Central Division pilot school, and was called Camarines Sur high school annex. The pioneer Administrator was Mr. Pedro O. Bornas, principal of mother high school - Camarines Sur high school, Naga city during the incumbency of Jaime T. Malanyaon, the provincial Superintendent of schools for the division of Camarines Sur. However, Mrs. Rosario P. Galicia and Mrs. Paula M. Nagrampa, District Supervisors and central principals respectively, helped in the administration and supervision of the school. Its operation began in school year 1966-1967 with classes up to second year having eight teachers and a total of 185 students.<p>





<p>In 1970, municipal resolution no. 63, series of the same year has been passed requesting the higher authorities of the Department of Education to make Calabanga High School independent and distinct from the mother high school. The request was finally approved in 1971 and took effect beginning school year 1971-1972 and was named Calabanga high school.<p>






<p>Mr. Diosdado Silvestre I, the Guidance Counselor of Camarines Sur High School became the full-fledged principal. The school was transferred to another site owned by the Municipal government of Calabanga, about 100 meters from the town plaza which is now the municipal market. During that time, the school had twelve teachers, a guidance counselor and a school janitor. The torchbearer-official organ with Mr. Mariano Ariola, the guidance counselor acted as adviser was also published.<p>






<p>As a barrio high school, then a municipal high school by virtue of department circular No. 65, s. 1975, it suffered problem of weak financial structure, probably the weakest among the three (3) levels of education. To solve this problem, several concerted attempts starting from the administration of Mrs. Nieves P. Badiola to Mr. Pedro E. Bermudo, Jr. To convert the school to a national high school were made but did not succeed. Later on, the municipal council passed a resolution proposing the fusion of Calabanga High School with Calabanga school arts and trades with the end view of addressing teacher’s problems on salaries and poor school facilities. Majority of the teachers, parents and students did not approved the idea, thus the proposal was dropped. The reaction was indicative of a rare choice, willingness to suffer rather than lose identity of Calabanga High School. <p>







<p>After so many long years of suffering from financial crisis, finally in 1998, under the Aquino administration, the government had a turn-about on its program in education. It became the first priority, and free public secondary education was implemented by republic act 6655 effective school year 1988-1989. The financial needs of the school were taken care of by the nation government. Salaries were upgraded, standardized and released on time. New facilities were constructed and more textbook were printed and distributed. So that the school would be assured of continued progress, new school buildings were constructed but unfortunately, Calabanga High School was not among the recipients. To construct a new one, it became a matter of policy that standard school site must be owned. Toward this end, the school administration under the leadership of Dr. Teresita S. Beriña, the OIC - principal, with the support of the teachers, parents and students acquired a new elevated two-hectare school campus situated at Sta. Cruz-Ratay, Calabanga, Camarines Sur, now its permanent campus, it was in 1955 that the night and summer classes were dissolved for the reasons that secondary education was already free.<p>






<p>However, to further democratize access to secondary education, night classes were again opened during the school year 2002-2003.<p>

<p>In 1991, Dr. Teresita S. Beriña was promoted to principal II at Nabua National High School. She was succeeded by Mr. William A. Villare, a head Teacher from Sto. Tomas High School, Camaligan, Camarines Sur, who later became the school principal. Like his predecessors, he worked hard to improve the quality of instruction side by side with the improvement of physical facilities such as the construction of new school buildings, the famous of which was the two-storey SEDP-SBP school building in 1993, the acquisition of brand new equipment and apparatuses for science, technology and livelihood education, and other areas of learning.  <p>


<p>Through the years Calabanga National high school has undergone metamorphosis from a mere annex school of Camarines Sur National High School in Naga city to a progressive educational institution that in turn has given birth to six (6) annex schools under the Administration of Mr. William a. Villare. In 1989 the first annex school named union high school in Sto Domingo, Calabanga  Camarines sur started its operation with Mrs. Emily O. Amon as its pioneer teacher-in-charge. Medroso-Mendoza high school in Binanuanan Pequeño headed by Mrs. Estrella F. Belleca and Jose de villa Memorial High School headed by Mrs. Maria P. Gueriba were simultaneously established in 1994. And in 1997, three (3) more annex schools were established- Sabang High School in Sabang Calabanga headed by Miss Natividad Q. Carillo (now Mrs. De Leon) Quipayo High School in San Antonio, Quipayo headed by Mrs. Silvia D. Obias, and West Coast High School in Dominorog Calabanga first headed by Mr. Redendor S. Malanyaon, then by Mr. Samuel A. Salalima and by Mr. Lope C. Espiritu. In august , 2000 four (4) of the six (6) annex schools started working out for legislation as national high school and were able to operate independently. West Coast high school and Sabang High school are also on process of separation.<p>




<p>When Mr. William A. Villare was assigned at pili National high school, pili, Camarines sur on October 1, 2004, Mrs. Emily B. Esmabe succeeded him. On July 5, 2005, Dr. Lilian Paredes - Rubi became the newest principal of the school. Modern equipment were produced, IT - Instruction were fully implemented, more and more buildings were added, to accommodate the expanding academic population and the campus was given a total makeover in terms of landscaping. Ad through the days , positive change in all areas of learning were observable , as this school is committed to be catalyst of progress through secondary education at every doorstep, and will continue to uphold the maxim : " Let knowledge grow from to more and thus must be human life enriched". Truly, academic excellence is not an elusive dream to realize, when everybody's effort is put together for realistic, effective and consistent development through the participatory management.<p>





<p>The evolution of the school's name from Camarines Sur High School annex in 1966 to Calabanga community high school in 1969, to Calabanga community High School in 1969, to Calabanga High School in 1971 and finally Calabanga National high school in 2001 became a trademark of excellence, as every change depicted remarkable struggle and victory to cast off ignorance and literacy. Now, tested by time Calabanga national high school stands firm, stable and united in its advocacy. <b>Long live!</b><p>
